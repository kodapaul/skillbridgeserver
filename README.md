Git or Version Control:
- Don't commit anything to master
- Create Branch to complete task
- Name the branch with this format... "git checkout -b <user>/<task number>-<name-of-task>" or "git checkout -b admin/200-name-of-task"
- Don't name branch with capital or spaces. Always use lowercase and dash for spaces
- To check current branch run "git branch"
- To check all remote branches run "git branch -a"
- To pull a branch run "git checkout <branch-name>" or git checkout admin/200-name-of-task
- Before committing a branch make sure you merge it with master. E.G. on branch 120. "git merge master"
- After commiting and push a branch to remote, create a pull request and add thepauldv as a reviewer
